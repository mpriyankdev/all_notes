Processor memory performance gap.

Modern processor architecture:

CPU Cores
L1 cache
L2 cache [may or may not be shared , depends on the architecture]
L3 cache [shared between cores]
Northbridge [data flows through them from cache to main memory]
Main memory

1byte : 48 transistors

Unix Memory Model:[Unix process]
Text --> Data --> Heap --> Stack

Each thread in Unix will have its own stack frame and it will share access to the heap.

application thread and os thread are the same in java.

Unix process memory model : 
MMU : converts virtual addresses to the underlying physical address.
TLAP : Translation look ahead buffer.

Context switch : 
-Heavy weight context switch : a thread from once process needs to access some other thread from other process.Full reload needs to happen in the MMU.
